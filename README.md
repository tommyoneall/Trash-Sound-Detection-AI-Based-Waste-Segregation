# Sound Recognition for Waste Classification

This project involves training a sound recognition model to classify waste materials into two categories: cans and plastic. The model listens to audio data and distinguishes between the sounds produced by these materials, which can be used in waste management applications.

## Features
- **Sound Classification**: Classifies sounds into two categories: cans and plastic.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Can be adapted for real-time sound recognition systems.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning algorithms to train a model based on sound data.
